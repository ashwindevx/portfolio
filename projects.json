    "name": "Spotify Clone",
    "description": "The inspiration for building this app came from Ashwin's love of Spotify's music recommendations and UI/UX. Using Vite, vanilla JS, and TailwindCSS, Ashwin built a clone of the platform with features such as authentication using Spotify's API, featured and top playlists, play/pause/next/previous/volume controls, and a song duration bar. The project provided an opportunity for Ashwin to learn about core JavaScript concepts and work with HTML and vanilla JavaScript, rather than relying on libraries or frameworks.",
